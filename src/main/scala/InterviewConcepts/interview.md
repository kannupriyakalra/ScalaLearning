In Scala, there are three ways of defining things: val, var, and def. Here are the main differences between them:
val defines a fixed value that cannot be modified after declaration. It is similar to a final variable in Java. For example: val x = 10
var defines a variable that can be modified after declaration. It is similar to a regular variable in Java. For example: var y = 20
def defines a method that can take parameters and return a value. It is similar to a method in Java. For example: def add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
One of the benefits of using val over var is that it makes the code more immutable and functional, which can prevent unwanted side effects and improve readability. However, sometimes var is necessary for certain situations, such as updating a counter or a buffer.
One of the benefits of using def over val or var is that it allows for lazy evaluation and recursion, which can improve performance and expressiveness. However, sometimes val or var is more convenient for simple expressions or constants.
