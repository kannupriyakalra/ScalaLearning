  merge2-
as we have 2 already sorted list and 2 list ie why 4 pattern match cases
l1 non empty l2 non empty, if (head1 < head2) head1 :: merge(tail1,  head2 :: tail2 head of both list will be compared and if (head1 < head2) head1 is added by prepending to o/p list while calling
merge on the tail1 and l2 list as it is.
l1 non empty l2 empty, add l1 to o/p list directly as its already sorted
l1 empty l2 non empty, add l2 to o/p list directly as its already sorted
l1 empty l2 empty- o/p list is nil
l1 is head1 :: tail1, l2 is head2 :: tail2
minimum element for both list is their respective head n lists are sorted so we compare head, result list is also sorted so element inserted is min of current head n call remaining list recursively

mergeTail-
do like u did factorial
- recursively ek result list sath le k chal in merge and prepend o/p in that and reverse that list in the end.
head1 :: result--adding head1 to result list
case (head1 :: tail1, Nil)-- result jo abhi tak gather hua hai vo reverse tarikay se hua hai so uss result me l1 add krna hai.  reverse ++ l1
case (Nil, Nil)-- means came to end of both list, so return the result by reversing it
 //why merge2 didnt require reversing result of result list, head 1 is first element its decided then that is prepended to o/p of recursive calling of merge2 which will be sorted.

/*
mergeSort-
merge sort algorithm - continuously splits a list into multiple sublists until each sublist has only one item left. It then merges those sublists into a sorted list.
time complexity analysis-
whenever we divide a number into half in every step, it can be represented using a logarithmic function, which is log n.
Merge sort repeatedly divides the array into two equally sized parts. Thus merge sort time complexity depends on the number of division stages. The number of division stages is log nbase2.
On each merge stage, n elements are merged.
Merge Sort time complexity is calculated using time per division stage. Since the merge process has linear time complexity, for n elements there will be nâˆ—log 2 n division and merge stages.
