Scala apply

apply is a magic Scala method. There is no need to call apply explicitly to execute it. And this is part of the tool that the case class use.

apply can be called like any other method ( Person.apply(...) ) but it can be used without calling its name explicitly ( Person(...) ). And that's it.

In fact, you could implement a function yourself:

val add = new Function2[Int, Int, Int] {

  def apply(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b

}

val result = add(1, 2)

assert(result == 3)

Try and copy it above in the editor.

You could also implement if yourself ! Try it by yourself before looking at Scastie.
