/*
The statement "points of a polygon are not self-intersecting in nature" means that the vertices or corners of the polygon, when connected in order to form the sides of the polygon, do not cross over
each other. In other words, the edges of the polygon don't intersect or cross within the interior of the polygon itself. example-  triangles, squares.

to calculate the area of a polygon -
1. Divide the polygon into triangles
2. Calculate the area of each triangle
3. Sum the areas of the triangles

Divide the polygon into triangles = for 7 points as i/p = p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7
p1, p2, p3
p1, p3, p4
p1, p4, p5
p1, p5, p6
p1, p6, p7
p1 is common ie firstPoint
twoPointPairs is a list of sequence of pairs List[Seq[(Int, Int)]]

given 3 edges of different lengths a, b, c the area of triangle = âˆš [s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c) ] ; s = semiperimeter of the triangle = (a+b+c)/2
//search " given 3 different edges what is the area of triangle" in chatgpt
1.Measure or obtain the lengths of the three sides of the triangle (a, b, and c)
2.Calculate the semiperimeter (s)
3.Plug the values of a, b, c and s into Heron's formula to calculate the area (A).
