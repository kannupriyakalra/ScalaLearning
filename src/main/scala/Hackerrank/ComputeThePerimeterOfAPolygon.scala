/*
1. Perimeter of a irregular polygon = sum of each length of each side  = Side1 + Side2 + Side3 + ... + SideN

2. side length = distance between 2 points when their coordinates are given (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) = âˆš { (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 } //search " how to calculate distance between 2 points when their
coordinates are given" in chatgpt

3. To pair adjacent points of a sequence in Scala and create a list of those pairs, you can use the sliding method. //search "how pair adjacent elements of a sequence in scala and make a list of
them" in chatgpt

val originalSequence : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val pairedList : List[List[Int]]  = originalSequence.sliding(2).toList // Use the `sliding` method to pair adjacent elements
// `pairedList` now contains List(List(1, 2), List(2, 3), List(3, 4), List(4, 5))

/*
yield-
In Scala, "yield" is a keyword used with "for comprehensions" to produce a value as a result of iterating over a collection or performing some operations.
It's like saying, "Give me this value as the output of my loop or sequence of operations." It's often used to create a new collection or transform data while
looping over an existing one. So, "yield" is a way to collect and return results from each step of a loop or sequence, making your code more expressive and
functional.
