no call is made in pattern matching, only pattern is compared
try Right(in.toInt) is equivalent to Right(in.toInt).apply--here object of Right is created based on i/p from readline and it goes in either, new is not written as case class Right

Type Either a string or an Int: 5
You passed me the Int: 5, which I will increment. 5 + 1 = 6
Right(6)

Type Either a string or an Int: gagan
You passed me the String: gagan

  as we don't need Left ie why Left is not written and order of cases is important as they run one by one so Right has to be written first and after that _ case executes
  asInstanceOf means type casting from this type ie Either[A, B] to  Either[A, B1], for remaining cases same this is retunred. ususally pattern matching is used for type casting and not asInstanceOf
