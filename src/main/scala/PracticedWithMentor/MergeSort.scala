  // 2 and 2, 2 into 1 and 1 , logn means kitne layers bann rahe hai and on every layer 0(n) operations as merge is called ,depth of mergesort is logn means merge sort is called logn times, on every
  // layer merging has to be done using merge and merge s complextiy is n so nlogn, time complexity means total no. of operations.
  //space complexity-at max extra space reqd- merge method makes new list ie the extra space- new list is O(n) so space complexity is O(n) as at every layer after recursion merging is done and merge creates
  // a new list and o/p memory of previous recursion is taken back by garbage collector.

merge sort algorithm - continuously splits a list into half of it and does the same for all sublist until each sublist has only one item left. It then merges those sublist into a sorted list.
time complexity analysis-
whenever we divide a number into half in every step, it can be represented using a logarithmic function, which is log n.
Merge sort repeatedly divides the array into two equally sized parts. Thus merge sort time complexity depends on the number of division stages. The number of division stages is log nbase2.
On each merge stage, n elements are merged.
Merge Sort time complexity is calculated using time per division stage. Since the merge process has linear time complexity, for n elements there will be nâˆ—log 2 n division and merge stages.
