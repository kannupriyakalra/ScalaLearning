merge sort algorithm - continuously splits a list into half of it and does the same for all sublist until each sublist has only one item left. It then merges those sublist into a sorted list.
time complexity analysis-
whenever we divide a number into half in every step, it can be represented using a logarithmic function, which is log n.
Merge sort repeatedly divides the array into two equally sized parts. Thus merge sort time complexity depends on the number of division stages. The number of division stages is (log nbase2).
On each merge stage, n elements are merged.
Merge Sort time complexity is calculated using time per division stage. Since the merge process has linear time complexity, for n elements there will be nâˆ—log 2 n division and merge stages.

what is time complexity of merge sort O(nlogn)?
n -> n/2 -> n/4 -> ... 1 , these are logn base2 values (logn base2 means how many times n should be divided into n/2 until it gets reduced to 1), log 8base2 =3 because
2^3 = 8 so 3 layers 8 is divided into 4 and 4, 4 into 2 and 2, 2 into 1 and 1 , logn means the no. of levels that are made ,depth of mergesort is logn means merge sort is called logn times,
and on every layer 0(n) operations as merge is called, on every layer merging has to be done using merge and merge s complexity is n so nlogn,
time complexity means total no. of operations.

1.time complexity of merging 2 list by our merge function is O(n)
2. we are merging the 2 list logn times as thats the no. of levels
n * logn

space complexity means max extra space required- merge method makes new list ie the extra space- new list is O(n) so space complexity is O(n) as at every layer after recursion merging is done and
merge creates a new list and o/p memory of previous recursion is taken back by garbage collector.

we are realigning the elements of list and not creating the elements again.
